# Julia Packages

The Julia ecosystem contains over 4,500 packages that are registered in the [General registry](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General), which means that finding the right package can be a challenge. Fortunately, there are services that can help navigate the ecosystem, including:

* [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com) — a [Julia Computing](https://juliacomputing.com) service that includes search of all registered open source package documentation, code search, and navigation by tags/keywords. It is powered by [Julia Team](https://juliacomputing.com/products/juliateam). 
* [JuliaObserver](https://juliaobserver.com) — see what packages are popular and/or trending, navigate by package categories.
* [Julia.jl](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl) — a manually curated taxonomy of Julia packages (category information for JuliaPackages is derived from this as well).
